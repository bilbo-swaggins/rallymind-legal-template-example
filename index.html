        <h3>Restraining Orders and Domestic Violence</h3>
        <p>A restraining order or an order of protection is almost always a part of a domestic violence case. In order to protect victims of violence and abuse, court orders can be sought out by victims in order to prevent further abuse. A restraining order or order of protection may provide temporary or long-term protection for a domestic violence victim by prohibiting the accused abuser from coming within a certain distance of the victim or from contacting him/her.</p>
        <h3>Restraining Orders</h3>
        <p><strong>What is a restraining order?</strong> Many people are under the impression that a restraining order is a simple document that can be obtained to help prevent a person from coming into contact with them. The truth of the matter is that a restraining order is in fact a complex legal action that not only prevents a person from coming into contact with another, but it may force them to move out of their home or prevent them from seeing any other members of the family. A restraining order can result in job loss for an individual as well, especially if an employer believes that they are now a threat to others in the workplace. Having a restraining order taken out against you can be a very destructive legal action, even if it was out of mistake. Be sure to have your defense attorney review the restraining order and investigate the allegations to help protect your rights.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Defending restraining orders and orders of protection is a service which we provide for our&nbsp;clients. When a restraining order is sought and obtained for frivolous or false means, our attorneys can help you contest the restraining order and possibly have it lifted. A long-term restraining order may result in a person not being able to see his/her spouse and/or children for years.</p>

          <h2>Child Abuse</h2>
          <p>Child abuse is one of the most serious domestic violence-related accusations that a person can face. Crimes against children are not tolerated and are harshly prosecuted by law enforcement and state prosecutors.</p>
          <p>When facing child abuse accusations or charges, it is in your best interest to consult a Los Angeles criminal defense attorney as soon as possible. An attorney will be able to protect your rights and interests right away and may even be able to negotiate with the prosecutor in order to have your charges lessened, dropped, or to avoid formal charges altogether. Don't let your future be ruined because of a false accusation of child abuse. Instead, consult a defense lawyer and ensure that your rights and future are protected.</p>

          <h2>Restraining Orders</h2>
          <p>A restraining order is often a part of a domestic violence accusation, charge and criminal case. A restraining order is a court order which is meant to protect the victims of abuse and domestic violence. These range from a temporary order, issued by law enforcement for 5 days, to a more permanent restraining order which may last for 3 years.</p>
          <p>A defense lawyer can help a person who has been served a restraining order. Although you cannot and should not come into contact with the victim who filed the restraining order, you can consult a Los Angeles defense lawyer to see what can be done to have the order lifted.</p>
